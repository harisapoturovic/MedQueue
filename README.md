# MedQueue

This project simulates a single-server queue system in the context of an ambulance service. It generates synthetic data for patients, simulates their arrival and service times, and prioritizes patients based on their assigned priority. The simulation outputs a table detailing the key metrics for each patient, such as waiting time, service start time, service end time, and time spent in the system.

Features
- Generation of synthetic patient data with random interarrival times, service times, and priorities.
- Simulation of a single-server queue system for ambulance service.
- Prioritization of patients based on assigned priority.
- Calculation and display of key metrics for each patient.
- Clear and concise output format for easy analysis.
